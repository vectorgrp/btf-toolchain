How to read the source code documentation {#source}
==================================================

The documentation of the source code is generated via doxygen. Its source is the function descriptions in the header files. \n
In the tree index, three index tabs help to access the source code documentation:
* namespaces: source code organized according to namespaces,
* classes: source code organized according to classes,
* files: source code organized according to files.

The most important part of the source code documentation is the btf::BtfFile class, as it contains all the necessary functions to create a BTF file.
