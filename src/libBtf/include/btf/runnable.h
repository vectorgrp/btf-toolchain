  @brief Class for Runnable Events (see BTF Specification Chapter 2.3.3).

  A runnable (R) is called in context of a process instance or by another runnable. \n
  A called runnable starts and changes to RUNNING. If the process instance which includes the runnable gets removed from core (e.g. preempted), \n 
  the currently executed runnable is suspended and changes to state SUSPENDED. If the process instance gets allocated to core (e.g. resumed), \n
  the runnable changes to RUNNING. After complete execution, the runnable changes to TERMINATED.
